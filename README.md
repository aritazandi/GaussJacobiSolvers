# GaussJacobiSolvers

This Python project provides implementations for solving systems of linear equations using Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative methods, specifically for three variables and three equations. The project allows you to input equations manually or use predefined examples.

## Features

- **Jacobi Method**: Iterative method for solving systems of linear equations.
- **Gauss-Seidel Method**: Another iterative method that often converges faster than Jacobi.
- **Error Calculation**: Computes the error in the final solution.
- **Interactive Input**: Allows users to input their own equations and initial guesses.
